/**
 * What is settled about a read before bar 0, `compiled-program.md` 2.16.
 *
 * **A request's identity is fixed before bar 0.** That is what lets the whole
 * set be known at load, what lets a host fetch in parallel and cache by
 * instrument and timeframe, and what makes a request that changed afterwards
 * OS6013. So the three identity fields are resolved here, once, from the value
 * the script wrote, the setting it named or the chart fact it named, and
 * nothing below bar 0 ever asks again.
 *
 * **Two refusals belong at load and four belong to the host.** A timeframe the
 * language does not know (OS6001), one finer than the chart's (OS6002) and one
 * that does not fold into the chart's (OS6015) are facts about the program and
 * the chart, both known before a bar runs, so they stop the load and name what
 * was refused. An unknown instrument (OS6007), a range with no bars (OS6008), a
 * source that refused (OS6009) and an interval the feed does not carry (OS6014)
 * are the host's answers: they leave the read absent, put the reason in
 * `req.error(read)` and let the study keep drawing everything else, which is
 * `stdlib.md` 15.5.
