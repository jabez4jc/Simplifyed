/**
 * The per-bar session facts, derived from the instrument record.
 *
 * **The session is a range of hours in the instrument record and nothing else**
 * (`host-interface.md` 4.3). A host states `start`, `end` and the days it opens
 * on, once, at load; the per-bar facts follow from those hours, the bar's own
 * time and the instrument's timezone. The host is never asked whether a session
 * begins on a bar, because `language.md` 7.2 fixes the facts a host states
 * about an execution at four and `host-interface.md` 6.1 says an engine must
 * not ask a host for one of the rest. Two engines built from those pages
 * therefore anchor a session study on the same bar, which is the whole reason
 * the line between stated and derived is drawn where it is.
 *
 * **`isFirstBar` is the first bar delivered inside the hours.** A venue that
 * opened late still has a first bar, and a study anchored to the session has to
 * start on it; a rule that waited for the scheduled open would anchor nothing
 * at all on a day trading began a minute late.
 *
 * **`isLastBar` is the last bar of the schedule**, which is the fact that earns
 * the field its place: it is true even when trading stopped early, so a
 * strategy that must be flat by the close acts on it rather than on the
 * appearance of a new bar, which arrives too late. That is a bar slot measured
 * against the scheduled close, so it needs the interval, and a host that states
 * none leaves it absent rather than answered by the bar spacing, which the
 * specification does not promise is uniform.
 *
 * **Absence, never a guess.** A host that states no session leaves both facts
 * absent, which is what 4.1's record says a script sees: absent, and the per-bar
 * session facts absent with it. Absence is a value a script can test, and a
 * guessed session start would anchor every session study in this language to a
 * minute nobody chose.
 *
 * **A record that contradicts itself is refused instead**, at load, by
 * `recordProblem` below. A session with no zone to read its wall clock in, or
 * one spelled in a form the record does not take, is a host that believes it
 * stated a session, and answering that with the same absence an honest record
 * gives is how a host loses every session study and is told nothing.

/**
 * What the record is missing before any session fact can be read from it.
 *
 * `host-interface.md` 4.1 marks every fact here optional and 4.3 says what a
 * script sees when the session is one of them: absence, which a script can test.
 * That is the answer for a host that schedules no session, and it is not the
 * answer for the three records below, each of which is a host that believes it
 * stated one:
 *
 * - **A session and no timezone.** `start` and `end` are wall clock, so a
 *   window with no zone to read it in is not a window. Nothing about the record
 *   says which hours were meant, and every session study on that host draws
 *   nothing.
 * - **A session whose clock times are not `"HH:MM"`.** `"9:00"` is the spelling
 *   a host writes first and the one the record does not take.
 * - **Days outside one to seven.** Monday is 1 (`stdlib.md` 12.2), so a host
 *   numbering Sunday as 0 states a week the instrument never opens in.
 *
 * Each of the three is reported at load rather than answered with absence,
 * because absence there is indistinguishable from the honest case and the honest
 * case is the one a reader will assume. A bare read of an instrument fact the
 * host did not state is a different question with the opposite answer: it is
 * absent and never refused (`host-interface.md` 4.5, decision 66), because a
 * record the host contradicts itself in is not a fact it left out.
